/**
 * Channel-bringup abstraction for AC2.
 *
 * `Ac2Transport` (in `../transport`) models the *wire-level* concern:
 * once we have a duplex byte/JSON pipe, frame AC2 messages over it.
 * `Ac2ChannelProvider` models the level immediately above: **how do we
 * obtain that pipe from a remote peer in the first place?**
 *
 * The SDK is deliberately agnostic about the answer. Liquid Auth +
 * WebRTC is one valid bringup. A WebSocket relay, a Bluetooth LE link,
 * a local Unix socket, or an in-memory pair for tests are all equally
 * valid. Each is a separate `Ac2ChannelProvider` implementation that
 * lives outside the core SDK (in its own file or package).
 *
 * Consumers (plugins, agent runtimes) depend on this interface — not on
 * any concrete signaling stack — so that swapping bringups is a
 * one-line wiring change at the entrypoint.
 *
 * The split mirrors the relationship between `Ac2Transport` and the
 * various `rtcDataChannelTransport` / `createInMemoryTransportPair`
 * adapters: a small, runtime-agnostic interface in the core, with
 * concrete adapters shipped separately.
