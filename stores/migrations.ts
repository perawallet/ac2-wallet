 * The durable migration ledger, backed by the app's general-purpose MMKV

 *
 * The separation cuts both ways: if the `keystore` MMKV is cleared, or
 * restored from a backup older than this app's data, the ledger still says
 * every revision up to the last-recorded one has been applied. Restored
 * legacy records are then never re-flagged, because from the ledger's point
 * of view nothing changed.
