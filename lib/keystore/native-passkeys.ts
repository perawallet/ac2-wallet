/**
 * Folds the credentials the native provider holds into the passkey store's
 * current contents.
 *
 * The native list and the keystore describe the same credentials from two
 * sides: `WithPasskeysKeystore` builds a passkey out of the `k/<id>` metadata
 * record (carrying `keyId`, the derivation `scheme`, whether the relying party
 * has it registered), while the native provider knows the relying party and
 * the user name it displays in the system sheet. Neither is a superset of the
 * other, so a matching id is **merged** rather than replaced — this sync runs
 * on every launch, every resume and every autofill event, and replacing would
 * strip the keystore's fields (including `metadata.origin`, the field the
 * Liquid Auth flow matches a site against) on the way back from the system
 * passkey UI.
 *
 * @param existing - The passkeys currently in the store.
 * @param credentials - What `getStoredCredentials()` reported.
 * @returns The merged list: every native credential first, then the passkeys
 *   the native provider did not report (e.g. iOS-only or not yet synced).
